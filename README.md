# BLUETOOTH-BASED-HOME-AUTOMATION-USING-ARDUINO
Bluetooth-based home automation system using cell phones: In a Bluetooth-based home automation system the home appliances are connected to the Arduino BT board at input-output ports using a relay. The program of Arduino BT board is based on the high-level interactive C language of microcontrollers; the connection is made via Bluetooth. The password protection is provided so only authorized user is allowed to access the appliances. The Bluetooth connection is established between the Arduino BT board and the phone for wireless communication. In this system, the python script is used and it can install on any of the Symbian OS environments, it is portable. One circuit is designed and implemented for receiving feedback from the phone, which indicates the status of the device.
Make the connections as shown in the circuit diagram.
Upload the code to the arduino
Download the apk or create your own by replicating the blocks in mit inventor (or kodular) given and install it.
connect to the bluetooth module.
And control the devices.
